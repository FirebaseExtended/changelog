Dropped support for Node.js versions 8, 10, and 12. Dropped support for Admin SDK versions 8 and 9. Update withnpm install firebase-admin@latest --save. Dropped support for Firebase Test SDK for Cloud Functions version 2. Update withnpm install firebase-functions-test@latest --save. Removed the functions.handler namespace. Removed __trigger object on function handlers.See PR 1150. The Realtime Database DataSnapshot passed to the Realtime Database trigger nowmatches the DataSnapshot returned by the Admin SDK, with null valuesremoved. See PR #926. Logs created with the functions.logger package in 2nd gen functionsare now annotated with each request's trace ID, making it easy to correlatelog entries with the incoming request. Trace IDs are especially useful forcases where 2nd gen's concurrency feature permits a functionto handle multiple requests at any given time. SeeCorrelate log entries to learnmore. functions.logger.error now always outputs an error object and is includedin Google Cloud Error Reporting. SeePR #1141. The logging severity of Auth/App Check token validation has changed frominfo to debug level. Event parameters for 2nd generationfunctions are now strongly typed, permittingstronger TypeScript types for matched parameters. Reorganized source code location. This affects only apps that directlyimport files instead of using the recommend entry points specified in thepackage exports.See PR 1149.
